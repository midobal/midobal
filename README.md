Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Miguel Domingo. I work as a Ph.D. researcher at the [PRHLT Research Center](https://www.prhlt.upv.es/) from [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/). I have been mainly working in machine translation and historical document processing, but my interests also include other areas of machine learning, computational linguistics and pattern recognition. You can find more information about me at my [website](https://mdomingo.me/).

## Highlights
Here you can find highlighted what I consider to be some of my most useful contributions.

### Research
* **[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/midobal/dockerfiles)**: a collection of custom Dockerfiles for several tasks.
* **[Interactive Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/PRHLT/OpenNMT-py/tree/inmt)**: a fork of the [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) toolkit implementing several interactive machine translation protocols.
* **[MT Scripts](https://github.com/midobal/mt-scripts)**: a collection of several scripts useful for research in machine translation.
* **[Statistical Dictionary](https://github.com/midobal/sd)**: Given a parallel data set, this software trains a statistical dictionary for translating documents. It was built in Python and makes use of [mgiza](https://github.com/moses-smt/mgiza) for computing *IBM model 1* alignments.
* **[Word-Level AutoCompletion](https://github.com/PRHLT/OpenNMT-py/tree/inmt)**: a fork of the [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) toolkit that deploys a word-level autocompletion tool.

### Teaching
* **[Neural Machine Translation: a Practical Session](https://github.com/midobal/nmt-practical-session)**: a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook which presents a practical session to introduce the training of neural machine translation systems to students.

### Templates
* **[Dissertation](https://github.com/midobal/dissertation)**: the LaTeX template I designed for writing my Ph.D. dissertation.
* **[Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/midobal/jekyll-theme)**: custom tweaks to Jekyll's [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme based on [academic portfolio](https://github.com/ys1998/academic-portfolio).
* **[TwoCol Style](https://github.com/midobal/twocol-style)**: a custom two-columned LaTeX style template based on the [ACL Style template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).
